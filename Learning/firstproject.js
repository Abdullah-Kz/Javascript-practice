var name1 = "Abdul"
var name1 = "something"
let name2 = 'Abdullah';
let name3;
console.table([name1,name2,name3]);

/*
1: differece between let and var is simple let is block scope and var is function scope 
and let can be redeclared only out of the scope it was presiously declared in  and var cannot be redeclared through
out the code and if it is redeclared it will only change the value of the previously declared var with same varibale
name

2: It is usually preferred to use let instead of var when declaring variables because of its issue in block scope
and functional scope
